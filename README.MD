FrontEnd BackEnd Interactions

Author: Justin Montero

This program helps us show the interactions between a frontend, that is being displayed on a webpage, and our backend database using mongodb. The interactions that will be shown will be using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests that will occur on the frontend and then getting a response from our backend returning contacts that we made up for our database.
